Top 10 Words: Displayed the top 10 words for each year, based on their frequency.

Histograms: Plot histograms of word frequencies for each year to visualize the distribution of word frequencies.

Zipf's Law: Used Zipf's Law to plot log-log plots of word frequencies and their rank for each year, to see if there is a power-law relationship between the two variables.
